# 📊 Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis** project! This project analyzes text reviews using **TextBlob** to determine if the sentiment is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. The results are then visualized using a simple bar chart to show the distribution of sentiments.

## 🚀 Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies each review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on its sentiment score.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays the sentiment distribution of the reviews using a bar chart.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses text data for better sentiment analysis results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data loading and preprocessing.
- **TextBlob**: For performing sentiment analysis on text.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results.

## 📂 Project Structure


📦 sentiment-analysis-project
 ┣ 📂 data
 ┃ ┗ 📜 Reviews.csv             # Dataset of customer reviews
 ┣ 📂 src
 ┃ ┗ 📜 sentiment_analysis.py    # Main code for sentiment analysis
 ┣ 📜 README.md                  # Project documentation

 ┗ 📜 .gitignore                 # Ignore unnecessary files in Git


## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    bash
    cd sentiment-analysis
  
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the project**:
    bash
    python src/sentiment_analysis.py
  

## 📊 Example Output

The bar chart below is an example of the sentiment distribution:

``
 Positive | Negative | Neutral
`

The program will display the sentiment classification in a bar chart form, showcasing how many reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.

## 🔍 Data

- The dataset used for this project is a collection of customer reviews in CSV format (`Reviews.csv`).
- Each review is processed to extract the sentiment using **TextBlob**.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Implement additional text preprocessing techniques.
- Improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis using advanced NLP techniques.
- Extend to support larger datasets or integrate other libraries like `VADER` or `HuggingFace` for more nuanced sentiment detection.
